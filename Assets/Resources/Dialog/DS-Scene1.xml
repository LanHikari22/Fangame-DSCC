<text> Mid-August... </text>

<text> 
The summer of your second
year of high school is almost over. 
</text>

<text> 
People visiting Tokyo have
begun traveling back home. 
</text>

<text> 
It feels as if there are fewer
people about in shibuya... 
</text>

<left char="Hero" emotion="neutral" />
<text>
Your cousin Naoya, with whom
you'd been living until a few
</text>

<text>
years ago, suddenly called for
you to meet him outside 901...
</text>

<text name="Boy">
Hey, {HeroName}!
Over here!
</text>

<text>
A boy carrying a laptop
computer runs up to you.
</text>

<right char="Atsuro" emotion="happy" />
<pause />
<left emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Yo, how's it going?
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Real nice of Noaya to make us
meet him outside on a hot day
like this, isn't it?
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
So, how's your summer been? We
usually meet at school, so it
feels like it's been forever.
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
is everything good?
</text>

<choice direction="left" c1="Yeah." c2="Not really.">

<c1>
	<right emotion="excited" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	Ah, that's the {HeroName}
	I know! Young guys like us
	need to be full of energy!
	</text>

	<right emotion="happy" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	Still, I couldn't think of
	anything to do, so I spent all
	day on my laptop. Haha!
	</text>
</c1>

<c2>
	<left emotion="neutral" />
	<pause />
	<right emotion="neutral" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	Uh-oh... Did something happen?
	</text>

	<right emotion="happy" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	Well, I couldn't think of
	anything to do, so I spent all
	day on my laptop. Haha!
	</text>
</c2>
</choice>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
This is great timing though,
man. I just ran into this
problem with my coding.
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
It has me completely stumped,
so I was about to go ask Naoya
if he could help...
</text>

<text name="Girl">
Oh, there you are!
I've been looking for
you guys!
</text>

<left char="Yuzu" emotion="neutral" />
<pause />
<right emotion="excited" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Hey, here comes Yoohoo!
</text>

<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Don't call me "Yoohoo"
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
My name is &lt;color=yellow&gt;Yuzu&lt;/color&gt;!
Sheesh, will you stop calling
me that stupid nickname!?
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
Even boys at school call me
"Yoohoo," and it's your fault!
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Hehe, it's not that bad,
is it?
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
It's a friendly nickname!
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
And it's not just our class.
Some of the teachers actually
think your name is "Yoohoo."
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
That's because people like
you keep calling me that!
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Haha, it's working!
</text>

<choice direction="right" fallthrough="true" c1="Will you cut it out?" c2="Where's Noaya?">

<c1>
	<left emotion="sad" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	He keeps calling me "Yoohoo"...!
	</text>
</c1>

<c2></c2>

</choice>

<left emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Huh...?
Oh, that's right!
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
I ran into Naoya a moment ago,
and he asked me to give these
to Atsuro and you.
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
He said that something's come 
up and he won't be able to 
make it.
</text>

<right char="Atsuro" emotion="sad" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Aww, what's up with that?
Naoya stood us up! Wait, what did
he want you to give us?
</text>

<left char="Yuzu" emotion="surprised" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Here, take them.
They were a pain to carry
around in my bag, too.
</text>

<text> Yuzu opens her bag... </text>
<image link="COMPS" />
<choice direction="right" c1="They're game systems." c2="Naoya gave you these?">
<c1>
	<left emotion="neutral" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	Aren't these those 
	[Y:Communication Player] things?
	</text>
</c1>

<c2>
	<left emotion="neutral" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	Yep. Aren't these those 
	[Y:Communication Player] things?
	</text>
</c2>

</choice>

<text name="Yuzu">
I've seen commercials for them
before. They're like, "Play
with people around the world!"
</text>

<right char="Atsuro" emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Oh, you know about them,
Yoohoo? That's exactly what these are
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
The name "Communication Player"
is a real mouthful, so people
just call them COMPS.
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
They have email and a web
browser, so they're more like
cellphones than game systems.
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
Huh... Is that so?
</text>

<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Naoya said, "You'll all need
these. Don't let go of them."
</text>

<left emotion="neutral" />
<right emotion="excited" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Eh? "You'll all need"...?
Well, there are three of them.
</text>

<image activated="false" />
<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
...Still, why would we need
these? I mean, I've got a
COMP back at my own-- Huh?
</text>

<image link="blue COMP" />
<right emotion="serious" />
<text>
Atsuro opens one of the COMPs
and stares at it in wonder...
</text>

<right emotion="sad" />
<text name="Atsuro">
What the...?
I've never seen this menu.
Did he homebrew this?
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
What...? Do you mean he
made this himself? Is that
even possible?
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Huh? Don't you know, Yoohoo?
Naoya's famous among us
programmers. He's a genius!
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Something like this would be
no problem for him.
</text>

<left emotion="surprised" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Huh... I had no idea.
Is he really that good?
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Hmm... I can't open this
folder. Looks like it's
protected...
</text>

<left emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Protected...?
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
You mean, it's set so other
people can't mess with it?
We can't look inside, then.
</text>

<choice direction="right" c1="Just remove the lock." c2="Atsuro can crack it.">
<c1> </c1>
<c2>
	<right emotion="happy" />

</choice>

<right char="Atsuro" emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Heh heh, that's right!
Good thing I brought my
laptop along...
</text>

<text>
Atsuro connects the
COMP to his laptop and
begins typing furiously...
</text>

<left emotion="surprised" />
<text name="Yuzu">
...Huh!?
H-Hey, Atsuro!
What're you doing!?
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Heh heh! What does it
look like? I'm gonna hack
this folder wide open.
</text>

<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
You're hacking it...?
Hey, Naoya's gonna be
angry if you do that!
</text>

<choice direction="right" c1="It's not a big deal." c2="We'd better not, then.">

<c1>
	<left emotion="sad" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	Huuuuh?
	Are you sure about this?
	</text>

	<right char="Atsuro" emotion="neutral" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	You don't get it, Yoohoo!
	Naoya's my teacher.
	</text>
</c1>

<c2>
	<text name="Yuzu">
	He's right.
	C'mon, Atsuro, stop it!
	</text>

	<right char="Atsuro" emotion="neutral" />
	<text name="Atsuro">
	You guys don't get it!
	Naoya's my teacher.
	</text>
</c2>	
</choice>

<text name="Atsuro">
If he took the time to call
me up and give it to me...
</text>

<right emotion="excited" />
<text name="Atsuro">
That means he wants me to
break his protection scheme!
It's like a friendly greeting!
</text>

<left emotion="surprised" />
<text name="Yuzu">
That doesn't make any sense!
Why can't he say "hello"
like a normal person?
</text>

<right emotion="happy" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Let's take a look here...
What's his encryption
scheme this time?
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
...Heh heh heh![symbol: music]
Isn't this intense!?
</text>

<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
No! Only someone like you
would find this exciting,
Asturo!
</text>

<sound link="COMP BEEP" />

<right emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Hrrrrmmmm...
Ah, there we go!
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
You can at least check your
mail or now. Here, these
are yours.
</text>

<text> Atsuro gave you a COMP! </text>

<comment content="mail window opens here. How do you want to handle this? 
You need to read the whole mail before proceeding." />

<left char="Yuzu" emotion="sad" />
<text name="Yuzu">
At around 16:00 in
Shibuya-ku Aoyama, a man...
will be killed!?
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
He'll be attacked by some carnivorous beast...
</text>

<text name="Yuzu">
...!?
What kind of news is this?
That's so creepy...
</text>

<choice direction="right" 
c1="Yeah, that is creepy."
c2="It's just the news."
c3="The text is strange.">

<c1>
	<right emotion="sad" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	I know, right!? The way it's
	written so offhandedly just
	makes it even creepier...
	</text>
</c1>

<c2>
	<left emotion="surprised" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	Huh!? No, it's totally freaky!
	And the way it's so casual
	makes it even freakier!
	</text>
	<left emotion="sad" />
</c2>

<c3>
	<left emotion="surprised" />
	<text name="Yuzu">
	Hey!
	That' not the point!
	</text>
	<left emotion="sad" />
</c3>

</choice>

<right char="Atsuro" emotion="sad" />
<text name="Atsuro">
It also said there'll be a
blackout in Tokyo today...
What is this?
</text>

<text name="Atsuro">
It says it's today's news...
But none of this has happened
today.
</text>

<right emotion="excited" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Why would Naoya put a lock on
this...? Ooh, maybe it's code
for something!
</text>

<right emotion="serious" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Aoyama, Aoyama... Hmm...
Naoya's place is near there,
but is that important...?
</text>

<left emotion="scared" />
<text name="Yuzu">
That's enough!
This is way too creepy!
</text>

<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
I bet Naoya knew you would
tinker with the COMPs and
played a trick on us.
</text>

<right emotion="sad" />
<text name="Atsuro">
I don't know... He's amazingly
smart, so I think he must have
meant for this to happen.
</text>

<right emotion="serious" />
<text name="Atsuro">
Hmm... I can't figure it out
from just this. I'll try the
rest of these files, too.
</text>

<right emotion="neutral" />
<left emotion="neutral" />
  <text name="Atsuro">
    I'm gonna go find somewhere I
    can think. Go kill some time.
    Oh, you can take the COMPs!
  </text>

<text name="Atsuro">
Some of their functions still
work, so you might as well try
them out. See ya later, okay?
</text>

<right char="" />
<text>
Atsuro leaves the area to
take a closer look into
the COMP...
</text>

<right char="Hero" emotion="neutral" />
<pause />
<left emotion="angry" />
<text name="Yuzu">
I bet it's all just a prank.
Atsuro always acts like such a
kid with stuff like this!
</text>

<left emotion="neutral" />
<text name="Yuzu">
Um... What should we do,
Lan? Why don't we wanter
around until Atsuro's done?
</text>

<text> You and Yuzu leave the 901... </text>
